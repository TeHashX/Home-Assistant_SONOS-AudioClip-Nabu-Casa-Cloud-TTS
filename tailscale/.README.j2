Zero config VPN for building secure networks.

## About

Tailscale is a zero config VPN, which installs on any device in minutes,
including your Home Assistant instance.

Even when separated by firewalls or subnets, Tailscale just works. Tailscale
manages firewall rules for you, and works from anywhere you are.
